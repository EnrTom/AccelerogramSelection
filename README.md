NOTE:
- The software consists in two main folders. They have been zipped. To run the programs download and unzip the folders, and then refers to the descriptions below on how to run each analysis.
- A presentation, in both PowerPoint and pdf format, is saved in the same repository in order to provide the theoretical background.


ACCELEROGRAM SELECTION
By Enrico Tomassoli - enricotomassoli@gmail.com

Starting with a database of recorded accelerograms, the main aim is to select a subset of 7 time histories to be used in the analysis. The selection criteria are explained in the Presentation saved in this repository. Please refer to the file for more detail regarding the selection procedure. 

To start the program, after launching Matlab ©, run the file named  “Main.m” and follow the instructions on the screen. The program is self-explanatory. All the other “*.m” files are used by the main algorithm. The code was split among several files for more clarity during the debugging phase. The output, in the form of text files and images, are saved in the corresponding folders.


ACCELEROGRAM GROUPING

This code allows presenting the recorded accelerogram database when main parameter ranges are set. The main goal of this program is to preliminary analyze the data base composition before extracting information using the “Selection” procedure.

To start the program, after launching Matlab ©, run the file named  “Main.m” and follow the instructions on the screen. The program is self-explanatory. All the other “*.m” files are used by the main algorithm. The code was split among several files for more clarity during the debugging phase.
